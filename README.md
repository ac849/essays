*Princesses Against Plutonium* is a thought provoking photo representing the ways man and nature clash and how the things people do can affect the environment. The photo is of 9 women who invaded the Nevada Nuclear test site in full body suits and masks to hand out pamphlets to workers warning them of the hazardous effects nuclear radiation can have on the human body. These women were arrested however their act of rebellion inspired several 'copy cat' invasions and arrests that eventually caused a severe enough back up in the legal system that the Supreme Court decided to cut its losses and drop the charges agaisnt the original 9 princesses.
