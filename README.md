Human advancement is affecting the environment, an undeniable truth for anyone who pays attention to the world around them. Unfortunately, this effect is negative, and while many people look the other way, there has been an increasing number of people pushing for these changes to be acknowledged in recent years. As a result, art, which has always been a record of the changes in our social and natural environments, reflects this with an increasing number of artists creating pieces inspired by these environmental changes. Among these artists is an American Photographer, Richard Misrach.
    
# Princesses against Plutonium

*Princesses Against Plutonium* is a thought-provoking photo representing how man and nature clash and how people's actions can affect the environment. The photo is of 9 women who, in the spring of 1988, invaded the Nevada Nuclear test site in full body suits and purge masks to hand out pamphlets to workers. These pamphlets contained information warning workers of the hazardous and often invisible effects of nuclear radiation on the human body. These women were arrested relatively quickly. However, their rebellion inspired several 'copy cat' invasions and arrests that eventually caused a severe enough backup in the legal system that the Supreme Court decided to cut its losses and dismiss the charges against the original nine princesses. This photo, along with many of his other photos, shares the feature of a lack of saturation, which helps the viewer focus on the disturbing and impactful scenes he is representing rather than being distracted. It also helps magnify this sense and idea that the effect humans are having on the environment is depriving it of its vibrancy and how we are killing it.
