Human advancement is affecting the environment, an undeniable truth for anyone who pays attention to the world around them. Unfortunately, this effect is negative, and while many people look the other way, there has been an increasing number of people pushing for these changes to be acknowledged in recent years. As a result, art, which has always been a record of the changes in our social and natural environments, reflects this with an increasing number of artists creating pieces inspired by these environmental changes. Among these artists is an American Photographer, ==Richard Misrach=={Q7327841}. Richard Misrach, as a photographer, found many forms of documentarianism and aesthetic forms of photography exploitative, misleading, and untruthful for those viewing the photo. So in his pursuit to show the unfiltered truth of how humanity and the government are afffecting the environment, he turned his sights to the U.S.'s deserts, forgotten barren wastelands to most Americans, but to him, ground zero for the devastating effects humanity can have on the environment. This mission led to him becoming a master trespasser of many desert government facilities to document the harsh realities and later combined into a series he called *Desert Cantos*.

Through his series *Desert Cantos* and his trespassing activities, he met a group of activists who inspired a unique photo. ==*Princesses Against Plutonium*=={Q64159035} is a thought-provoking photo representing how man and nature clash and how people's actions can affect the environment. The photo is of 9 women who, in the spring of 1988, invaded the Nevada Nuclear test site in full body suits and purge masks to hand out pamphlets to workers. These pamphlets contained information warning workers of the hazardous and often invisible effects of nuclear radiation on the human body. These women were arrested relatively quickly. However, their rebellion inspired several 'copy cat' invasions and arrests that eventually caused a severe enough backup in the legal system that the Supreme Court decided to cut its losses and dismiss the charges against the original nine princesses. This photo and many of his other photos radiate this sense of isolation, bleakness, and dread. He achieves the vibe of bleakness through a lack of saturation, which helps the viewer focus on the disturbing and impactful scenes he is representing rather than being distracted. It also helps magnify this sense and idea that the effect humans are having on the environment is depriving it of its vibrancy and how we are killing it. He shows the isolation through the wide frame, which reveals miles of uninhabited wasteland, with a close-up of the Princesses showing how small and isolated we all are in the grander scheme of nature, especially with how we are affecting it. Finally, the incredible sense of dread is mainly conveyed through the Princesses in their full white suits and purge masks; they look like inhuman villains straight out of a sci-fi film, and again, the lack of saturation in the photo and the harshness of the light gives the viewer a sense that the radiation from the test site is having a noticeable effect right in front of the viewers' eyes.

*Desert Cantos* was filled with many jarring photos that sought to shed light on the beauty and brutality of this forgotten part of the ecosystem in the U.S. While Misrach did his fair share of photographing people and protestors as a way to document these barren landscapes he also turned to the wildlife to demonstrate the brutal otherworldliness of this environment. He often documented the dead animals left in the wake of man-made accidents or events to show the harmful effect that humans and the military had on this environment. Two such photos are shown above, with on-the-nose names being ==*Dead Animals #1*=={Q64159023} and *Dead Fish *.

Protestors and animals both serve as powerful tools to demonstrate humans' effect on the environment. However, sometimes, humanity leaves undeniable scars on our deserts that need no other explanation to make an impact. That is a feeling and artistic choice that Misrach leans into with his photos of the U.S.-Mexico border a subset of hist *Desert Cantos* series called ==*Border Cantos*=={Q128617874}. Showing the 'wall' and a shooting range that border patrol uses. Both show the wrongness and out-of-place feeling one gets when witnessing these man-made structures intended to hurt people and the environment.

Misrach's complicated relationship with America's deserts is something he has done various interviews on like the [*Archival Interview With Richard Misrach* ](https://aperture.org/editorial/archival-interview-richard-misrach/)with aperture focusing more on his lanscape photography for the series and the interview with Musee Magazine [*From Our Archives:Richard Misrach* ](https://museemagazine.com/features/2020/6/24/from-our-archives-richard-misrach)focusing more on his photos of the border. In addition to interview he has done lectures like [*Conversations with Artists: Richard Misrach, Desert Cantos and Other Landscapes*](https://soundcloud.com/nationalgalleryofart/conversations-with-artists-2?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) and even small documentaries with one such example being Art21's short documentary called *Richard Misrach in "Borderlands"*
